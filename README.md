# Project Description and Components

Clone this repo and open the two jupyternotebook to visualize the results and files. The documentation and instructions are combined within the jupyternotebook file. Open the presentation folder to find video detailing the presentation associated with the course project. It's best to view this in a google colab file to avoid any dependencies.


The best way to experience the workbook is to:
- Look at the demo video [here](https://vimeo.com/655137892)
- Click on the Data Set link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170dh1q2UmLE2KXIwYBc1pjJzxSbkxWIj?usp=sharing), go to "Share with me", and "Add shortcut to Drive" for the directory on you Google Drive. 
- Click on the Colab link [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ouXUU498m8zvbOt716A3MTWs85HmJhhB?usp=sharing) and run all cells (Runtime menu -> Run all). You will asked initially to authenticate access to your Google drive but it runs automatically after that. This could take half an hour, so go get some coffee.
- Peruse the notebook and click on the interactive bits for analyzing at topics.

Data Set [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170dh1q2UmLE2KXIwYBc1pjJzxSbkxWIj?usp=sharing) for the link to data sets. You should click on this link and then right click on it in your Google Drive 'Shared with me' directory to set an alias.  The notebook will use the alias to access the data sets.

    A zip file for the data sets is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GzLwS8opVQgFkOj_MUTTc65Hp3_44Z9z/view?usp=sharing). But, you shouldn't need this.

Run and make a copy of the google colab notebook [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170dh1q2UmLE2KXIwYBc1pjJzxSbkxWIj?usp=sharing)
